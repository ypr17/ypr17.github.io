I am currently a Ph.D. Candidate in the Department of Electronic Engineering at **Tsinghua University**, advised by Prof. Yongfeng Huang, and I also work closely with Prof. Tao Qi from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications.
Before that, I received my B.E. degree from Tsinghua University in 2021. 

My research interests primarily lie in **Large Language Model (LLM) Safety**, **Multi-modal Learning**, and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**. 
My research also encompasses data synthesis and augmentation techniques for LLM pre-training and SFT.

## 🔥 News
* **[2025.12]** We released **LiveSecBench**, a dynamic and event-driven safety benchmark for LLMs. [[Link](https://livesecbench.intokentech.cn/)]
* **[2025.11]** 🎉 Three papers are accepted to **AAAI 2026**, including two **Oral** presentations!
* **[2025.09]** 🎉 One paper on Black-Box Membership Inference Attack for LVLMs is accepted to **NeurIPS 2025**!

## 📝 Research Interests
* **Multi-modal Learning:** Vision-Language Models, Medical Multi-modal RAG.
* **LLM Safety & Alignment:** Membership Inference Attacks, Data Extraction.
* **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Knowledge Base Poisoning, Safe Retrieval.
* **Data Engineering:** Data Synthesis and Augmentation, Automated Evaluation Pipelines.
